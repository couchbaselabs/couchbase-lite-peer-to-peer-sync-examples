== Overview
Sample apps that demonstrate out-of-box websockets listener based peer-to-peer database sync functionality introduced in Couchbase Lite 2.8.

== Introduction

Couchbase Lite supports out-of-the-box support for secure

, over websockets directly between Couchbase Lite enabled clients in IP-based networks without the need for a centralized control point (i.e. no Sync Gateway or Couchbase server required)


== iOS Inventory App Tutorial in Swift
=== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building swift apps with Xcode and with Couchbase Lite.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you follow the
https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2./swift.html[Getting Started]
guides


* iOS (Xcode 12.5+)
** Download latest version from the
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[Mac App Store]

* Wi-Fi network that the peers can communicate over
** You could run your peers in multiple simulators.
But if you were running the app on real devices, then you will need to ensure that the devices are on the same WiFi network
