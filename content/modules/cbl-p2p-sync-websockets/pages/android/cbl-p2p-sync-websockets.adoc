IMPORTANT: The sample app uses pre-release/beta release version of Couchbase Lite software

== Introduction

Couchbase Lite 2.8 release supports out-of-the-box support for secure link:https://ibsoln.github.io/stage/h2beta/couchbase-lite/2.8/swift/learn/swift-p2psync-websocket.html[Peer-to-Peer Sync], over websockets, between Couchbase Lite enabled clients in IP-based networks without the need for a centralized control point. 


This tutorial will demonstrate how to - 

* Use link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/netservice[NetService] for peer discovery (i.e.to advertise and discover services/devices )
* Configure a websockets listener to listen to incoming requests. We will walk through various TLS modes and client authentication modes.
* Start a bi-directional replication from active peer.
* Sync data between connected peers

Throughout this tutorial, the terms "passive peer" and "server" will be used interchangeably to refer to the peer on which the websockets listener is started. The "active peer" and "client" will be used interchageably to refer to the peer on which the replicator is initialized.

We will be using a simple inventory app in swift as an example to demonstrate the peer-to-peer functionality.
====
You can learn more about Couchbase Lite https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2.7/introduction.html[here]
====

== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building swift apps with Xcode and with Couchbase Lite. 

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you follow the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2.7/swift.html[Getting Started] guides


* iOS (Xcode 11.4+) 
** Download latest version from the link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[Mac App Store]
                        
* Wi-Fi network that the peers can communicate over
** You could run your peers in multiple simulators. But if you were running the app on real devices, then you will need to ensure that the devices are on the same WiFi network

== App Overview
This is a simple inventory app that can be used as a link:https://ibsoln.github.io/stage/h2beta/couchbase-lite/2.8/refer-glossary.html#passive-peer[passive] or link:https://ibsoln.github.io/stage/h2beta/couchbase-lite/2.8/refer-glossary.html#active-peer[active peer]. 

The app uses a local database that is pre-populated with data. There is no Sync Gateway or Couchbase Server installed.

When used as a passive peer :-

* Users log in and start websockets listener for the couchbase lite database. A service corresponding to the listener is advertised over Bonjour.
* View the status of connected clients
* Directly sync data with connected clients

When used as a active peer :-

* Users can log in and start browsing for devices 
* Connect to a listener
* Directly sync data with connected clients

== Exploring the App Project

- The xcode project comes pre-bundled with some resource files that we will examine here

image::swift-project-explorer.png[alt=xcode project explorer,width=640,height=480]

* `samplelist.json` : JSON data that is loaded into the local Couchbase Lite database. It includes the data for a single document. See <<Data Model>>
* `userallowlist.json` : List of valid client users (and passwords) in the system. This list is looked up when the server tries to authenticate credentials associated with incoming connection request.
* `listener-cert-pkey.p12` : This is link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12[PKCS12] file archive that includes a public key cert corresponding to the listener and associated private key. The cert is a sample cert that was generated using link:https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] tool.
* `listener-pinned-cert.cer` : This is the public key listener cert (the same cert that is embedded in the `listener-cert-pkey.p12` file) in DER encoded format. This cert is pinned on the client replicator and is used for validating server cert during connection setup

== Data Model
Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store. A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values.The values are any valid JSON types. In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related. 

=== The "List" Document
The app deals with a single Document with a _"type"_ property of _"list"_.  This document is loaded from the `samplelist.json` file bundled with the project

An example of a document would be 

```json
{
    "type":"list",
    "list":[
      {
         "image":{"length":16608,"digest":"sha1-LEFKeUfywGIjASSBa0l/cg5rlm8=","content_type":"image/jpeg","@type":"blob"},
          "value":10,
          "key":"Apples"
      },
      {
        "image":{"length":16608,"digest":"sha1-LEFKeUsswGIjASssSBa0l/cg5rlm8=","content_type":"image/jpeg","@type":"blob"},
        "value":110,
        "key":"oranges"
       }
    ]
   
}
```
The document is encoded as a `ListRecord` struct defined in the `ListRecord.swift` file

=== Initializing Local Database

The app loads the data from the JSON document named `samplelist.json` the first time the database is created. This is done regardless of whether the app is ;launched in passive or active mode.

* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `openOrCreateDatabaseForUser()` method. This method creates an instance of Couchbase Lite database for the user if one does not exist and loads the empty database with data ready from bundled sample JSON file

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=OpenOrCreateDatabase]
----

* Open the *SampleFileLoaderUtils.swift* file and locate the `loadSampleJSONDataForUserFromFile()` method. This function parses the document in JSON and udpates it to embed the "image" property into every object in the "list" array. The "image" property holds a blob entry to an image asset. The image for the blob is available in the "Assets.xcassets" folder 

* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `createUserDocumentWithData()` method. This is where the document is saved into the database. Again, this is only done if there is no preexisting database for the user


[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=LoadData]
----

== Passive Peer or Server
First, we will walk through the steps of using the app in passive peer mode


=== Initializing Websockets Listener
* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `initWebsocketsListenerForUserDb()` function. This is where the websockets listsner for peer-to-peer sync is initialized


[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=InitListener]
----
<1> Initialize the `URLEndpointListenerConfiguration` for the specified database. There is a listener for a given database. You can specify a port to be associated with the listener. In our app, we let Couchbase Lite choose the port
<2> This is where we configure the TLS mode. In the app, we have a flag named `listenerTLSSupportMode` that allows the app to switch between the various modes. You can change the mode by changing the value of the variable. See <<Testing Different TLS Modes>>
<3> Enable delta sync. It is disabled by default
<4> Configure the password authenticator callback function that authenticates the  username/password received from the client during replication setup. The list of valid users are configured in `userallowlist.json` file bundled with the app

==== Testing Different TLS Modes 
The app can be configured to test different TLS modes as follows by setting the `listenerTLSSupportMode` property in the `DatabaseManager.swift` file

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=ListenerValidationTestMode]
----

[cols="2,2", options="header"] 
.TLS Modes on Listener
|===
|listenerTLSSupportMode Value |Behavior 

| TLSDisabled
| There is no TLS. ALl communication is plaintext (insecure mode)


| TLSWithAnonymousAuth
| The app uses Couchbase Lite APIs to auto-generate an anonymous server cert and to use that as `TLSIdentity` of the server. Communication is encrypted


| TLSWithBundledCert
| The app generates `TLSIdentity` of the server from  public key cert and private key bundled in the`listener-cert-pkey.p12` archive. Communication is encrypted 


|===

=== Start Websockets Listener
* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `startWebsocketsListenerForUserDb()` method. 

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=StartListener]
----

=== Advertising Listener Service
In the app, we use link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/netservice[NetService] to advertise the websockets listener service listening at the specified listener port. This aspect of the app has nothing to do with Couchbase Lite. In your production app, you can use any suitable mechanism including using a well known URL to advertise your service that active clients can be preconfigured to connect to.

* Open the *ServiceAdvertiser.swift* file and look for `ServiceAdvertiser` class. Here, we advertise a link:https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/[Bonjour] service with service type of _`_cblistservicesync._tcp`_

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/discovery/ServiceAdvertiser.swift[tags=ServiceDefinition]
----


* The service is published as implemented in the `doStart()` method. 

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/discovery/ServiceAdvertiser.swift[tags=StartAdvertiser]
----
Explore the content in the `ServiceAdvertiser.swift`. It includes implementation of the `NetServiceDelegate` delegate callback methods to accept incoming connections.

=== Stop Websockets Listener
* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `stopWebsocketsListenerForUserDb()` method. You can stop the listener at any point. If there are connected clients, it will warn you that there are active connections. If you choose to stop listener, all connected clients will be disonnected

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=StopListener]
----

=== Try it out
* Run the app on a simulator or a real device. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* On login screen, sign in as any one of the users configured in the `userallowlist.json` file such as "bob" and "password"
* From the "listener" tab, start the listener by clicking on "Start Listener" button
* Click on the "action" button to see number of connected clients. It should be 0 if there are no connected clients
* From the "listener" tab, stop the listener by clicking on "Stop Listener" button

image::ios-passive-start-listener.gif[alt=server websockets listener login screen,width=600,height=320]

== Active Peer or Client
We will walk through the steps of using the app in active peer mode

=== Discovering Listeners
In the app, we use link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/netservice[NetService]  to browse for devices that are advertising services with name _`_cblistservicesync._tcp`_. This aspect of the app has nothing to do with Couchbase Lite. In your production app, you could launch your listener at well known URL well and preconfigure your active peer to connect to the URL.

* Open the *ServiceBrowser.swift* file and look for `ServiceBrowser` class. Here, we browse for a service with service type of _`_cblistservicesync._tcp`_ using link:https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/[Bonjour]

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/discovery/ServiceBrowser.swift[tags=StartBrowsing]
----
Explore the content in the `ServiceBrowser.swift`. It includes implementation of the `NetServiceDelegate` delegate callback methods to resolve the service to its IP Address and port that will be used by the client to connnect to the listener.


=== Initializing and Starting Replication
Initialilzing a replicator for peer-to-peer sync is fundamentally not different than if your Couchbase Lite client were to link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/2.7/swift.html#replication[syncing] with a remote Sync Gateway. 

* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `startP2PReplicationWithUserDatabaseToRemotePeer()` method. If you have been using Couchbase Lite to sync data with Sync Gateway, this code should seem very familiar. In this function, we initialize a bi-directional replication to the listener peer in continuous mode. We also register a Replication Listener to be notified of status to the replication status.

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=StartReplication]
----

<1> Initialize a Repicator Configuration for the specified local database and remote listener URL endpoint
<2> This is where we configure the TLS server cert validation mode - whether we enable cert validation or skip validation. This would only apply if you had enabled TLS support on listener as discussed in <<TLS Modes on Listener>>. If you skip server cert validation,  you still get encrypted communication, but you are communicating with a untrusted listener. In the app, we have a flag named `listenerCertValidationMode` that allows you to try the various modes. You can change the mode by changing the value of the variable. See <<Testing Different Server Validation Modes>>
<3> The app uses basic client authentication to authenticate with the server
<4> Initialize the Replicator
<5> Start replication. The app uses the events on the Replicator Listener to listen to monitor the replication.

==== Testing Different Server Validation Modes
The app can be configured to test different TLS modes as follows by setting the `listenerCertValidationMode` property in the `DatabaseManager.swift` file

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=ListenerValidationTestMode]
----

[cols="2,2", options="header"] 
.TLS Listener Cert Validation
|===
|listenerCertValidationMode Value |Behavior 

| TLSSkipValidation
| There is no validation of server cert. This is typically in used in dev/test environments with self signed certs. Skipping server cert authentication is discouraged in production environments.  Communication is encrypted 


| TLSEnableValidation
| If the listener cert is a well known CA then you use this mode. Of course, in our sample app, the listener cert as specified in `listener-cert-pkey` is a self signed cert - so you probably will not use this mode to test. But if you have a CA signed cert, you can configure your listener with that cert and use this mode to test.  Communication is encrypted 


| TLSEnableValidationWithCertPinning
| In this mode, the app uses the pinned cert,`listener-pinned-cert.cer` that is bundled in the app to validate the listener identity. Communication is encrypted 


|===

=== Stopping Replication

* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `stopP2PReplicationWithUserDatabaseToRemotePeer()` method. If you have been using Couchbase Lite to sync data with Sync Gateway, this code should seem very familiar. In this function, we remove any listeners attached to the replicator and stop it. You can restart the replicator again in `startP2PReplicationWithUserDatabaseToRemotePeer()` method

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/list-sync/list-sync/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=StopReplication]
----

=== Try it out
* Follow instructions in "Try It Out" section of <<Passive Peer or Server>> to start app in passive mode on a simulator instance or real device. 
* Run the app on a separate simulator instance or a real device. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* On login screen, sign in as any one of the users configured in the `userallowlist.json` file such as "bob" and "password". An an exercise, try with an invalid user and ensure it fails
* Tap on the "browser" tab. The app automatically browses for listener and lists it here. 
* Tap on the row corresponding to listener. This will start replication with the listener and it shoud transition to Connected state
* Verify the connection count on listener
* Swipe left on the the row. You should see option to remove listener and Disconect. Try Disconnect and then reconnect again

== Syncing Data
Once the connection is established between the peers, you can start syncing. Couchbase Lite takes care of it.


=== Try it out
* Run the app on two or more simulators or real devices. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* Start the listener on one of the app instances. You could also have multiple listeners.
* Connect the other instances of the app to the listener
* Tap on the "List" tab 
* Edit the quanity or image on any one of the instances
* Watch it sync automatically to other connected clients

== What Next
As an exercise, switch between the various TLS modes and server cert validation modes and see how the app behaves. You can also try with different topologies to connect the peers.

== Learn More
Congratulations on completing this tutorial!

This tutorial walked you through an example of how to directly synchronize data between Couchbase Lite clients. While the tutorial is for iOS, the concepts apply equally to other Couchbase Lite platforms.
